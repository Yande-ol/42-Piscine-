# C03

**C03** focuses on **string comparison and concatenation functions**.

---

## What it covers

- Reproducing standard string functions: `strcmp`, `strncmp`, `strcat`, `strncat`.  
- Searching for substrings with `strstr`.  
- Concatenating strings safely with `strlcat`.  
- Working with null-terminated strings and character arrays.  
- Manipulating strings using pointers and loops.

## What to study to complete C03

- String basics: arrays of characters and null-terminated strings.  
- How standard string functions (`strcmp`, `strncmp`, `strcat`, `strncat`, `strstr`, `strlcat`) work internally.  
- Loops and conditionals for comparing and copying characters.  
- Pointer manipulation with strings.  
- Edge cases like empty strings and buffer limits.
