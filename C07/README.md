# C07

**C07** focuses on **dynamic memory allocation, string manipulation, and base conversions**.

---

## What it covers

- Duplicating strings dynamically (`ft_strdup`).  
- Creating ranges of integers with dynamic allocation (`ft_range`, `ft_ultimate_range`).  
- Joining multiple strings with a separator (`ft_strjoin`).  
- Converting numbers between bases (`ft_convert_base`).  
- Splitting a string into multiple substrings using a set of separators (`ft_split`).  
- Using `malloc` and `free` effectively for memory management.

## What to study to complete C07

- Dynamic memory allocation in C using `malloc` and `free`.  
- Handling strings and arrays of strings in memory.  
- Implementing string operations like concatenation and splitting.  
- Base conversion logic and careful handling of signs and whitespaces.  
- Pointer manipulation and returning dynamic arrays safely.
