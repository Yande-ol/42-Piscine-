# C06

**C06** focuses on **command-line arguments and program interaction**.

---

## What it covers

- Printing the **program name** (`ft_print_program_name`).  
- Printing all command-line arguments in the order they are received (`ft_print_params`).  
- Printing command-line arguments in **reverse order** (`ft_rev_params`).  
- Sorting command-line arguments in **ASCII order** and printing them (`ft_sort_params`).  
- Using `write` for output in all exercises.  

---

## What to study to complete C06

- The **main function** signature with `argc` and `argv`.  
- Iterating through command-line arguments with loops.  
- String comparison for ASCII sorting.  
- Printing strings one by one using `write`.  
- Understanding argument order and how to manipulate it.
