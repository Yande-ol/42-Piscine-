# C04

**C04** focuses on **numbers, string-to-integer conversion, and number representation in different bases**.

---

## What it covers

- Getting the **length of a string** (`ft_strlen`).  
- Printing strings (`ft_putstr`) and integers (`ft_putnbr`) using `write`.  
- Converting strings to integers (`ft_atoi`).  
- Printing integers in a **custom base** (`ft_putnbr_base`).  
- Converting strings from a given base to integers (`ft_atoi_base`).  
- Handling edge cases like invalid bases and negative numbers.

## What to study to complete C04

- String basics and pointer manipulation.  
- Using `write` to print strings and numbers.  
- ASCII values and how to convert characters to integers.  
- Loops and conditionals for processing strings and numbers.  
- Number bases and how to represent numbers in binary, decimal, hexadecimal, or custom bases.  
- Edge cases: empty strings, invalid bases, negative numbers, and multiple signs.
