# C05

**C05** focuses on **recursion, mathematical functions, and problem-solving with integers**.

---

## What it covers

- Calculating **factorials** iteratively (`ft_iterative_factorial`) and recursively (`ft_recursive_factorial`).  
- Computing powers iteratively (`ft_iterative_power`) and recursively (`ft_recursive_power`).  
- Generating the **Fibonacci sequence** and retrieving specific elements (`ft_fibonacci`).  
- Calculating the **integer square root** (`ft_sqrt`).  
- Checking **prime numbers** (`ft_is_prime`) and finding the next prime (`ft_find_next_prime`).  
- Solving the **Ten Queens puzzle** recursively (`ft_ten_queens_puzzle`) and displaying all solutions.

## What to study to complete C05

- Loops and recursion for iterative and recursive solutions.  
- Mathematical operations: factorial, powers, Fibonacci sequence.  
- Working with integers, including edge cases (negative numbers, 0, 1).  
- Logic for prime number detection and generating next primes.  
- Recursive backtracking strategies for puzzles like Ten Queens.  
- Using `write` to display results where required.
