# C01 

**C01** focuses on **pointers, memory manipulation, and basic array handling**.

---

## What it covers

- Using **pointers** to access and modify values in memory.  
- Handling **multiple levels of pointer indirection** (up to 9 levels).  
- Swapping values between integers via pointers.  
- Performing **division and modulo operations** using pointers.  
- Printing strings using **pointers and `write`**.  
- Determining the **length of a string** via a pointer.  
- Reversing and sorting arrays of integers using pointers.

## What to study to complete C01

- Pointer syntax (`*` and `&`) and dereferencing.  
- Multiple levels of pointer indirection.  
- Passing variables and arrays to functions via pointers.  
- Loops and conditional statements to manipulate arrays.  
- Using `write` to print strings.  
- Logic for swapping, reversing, and sorting integers.
