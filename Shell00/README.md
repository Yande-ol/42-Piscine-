# Shell 00 - Introduction to the Linux Terminal

In this project, you will develop fundamental skills for working in the Linux terminal and creating basic Shell scripts. The focus is on learning to manipulate files, permissions, links, and essential commands for automation and project management.

## What this project covers

- Creating and managing **files and folders**.
- Changing **file permissions and attributes** (`chmod`, `touch`).
- Using **symbolic and hard links** (`ln -s` and `ln`).
- Compressing and extracting files (`tar`).
- Automation with **Shell scripts** for repetitive tasks.
- Basic **Git commands** (`git log`, `.gitignore`).
- Comparing and applying differences between files (`diff`, `patch`).
- Searching and filtering files (`find`).
- Understanding **magic files** and file types.

## What to study to succeed

1. **Basic Linux commands**: `ls`, `cat`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `chmod`, `ln`.
2. **File and permission management**: reading, writing, executing files; understanding users and groups.
3. **Links**: difference between hard link and symbolic link.
4. **Compression and archiving**: creating and extracting `.tar` files.
5. **Shell scripting**: creating simple scripts to automate terminal tasks.
6. **Basic Git**: checking commits, using `.gitignore`.
7. **Comparison tools**: using `diff` and applying changes with `patch`.
8. **Search and filtering**: using `find` to locate and manage files.
9. **Magic files**: identifying file types and understanding their applications.
