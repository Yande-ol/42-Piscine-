## 🛟 Safety Instructions

### 🏊 Swim through the projects  
Don’t worry about doing everything perfectly. Avoid staying stuck in the same project for too long — move forward at a constant pace. If an exercise feels impossible, **skip it and return later**. With practice, concepts will click naturally.  

### 🎓 No cheating – choose learning instead  
You will often face exercises that seem impossible at first. That’s the **point of the Piscine**.  
The right way: **use references**, study solutions, test, debug, and rewrite by memory until the concepts become clear.

## ⏳ Practice, Practice, Practice...  

Take some time every week to practice the **exam exercises**.  
The exam is not just a test — it’s a way to **prove your progress**.  

👉 I recommend you simulate exam conditions and work under time pressure to build confidence.

## 🖥️ Environment  

If you want to study at home with a setup similar to 42:  
- Use **Linux** (Ubuntu recommended).  
- Or install **WSL2 on Windows**.  
- Configure your editor (VS Code or Vim) with the same tools as at school.
